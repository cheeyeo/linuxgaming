So I went to the website and checked, and I was right, it says the stable version is 3.0.2 and the dev version is 3.12. However I googled some more and then I found update notes for versions 3.9 and 3.8, and now I\u0026#39;m just confused as hell, what are these versions? what\u0026#39;s the latest one I\u0026#39;m supposed to use?

No other program or podcast made real system administrators and those working in networking or systems design and deployment or any variety of technical, lonely, misunderstood, and isolating thankless difficult IT positions spoke to its audience using the same clear, totally unshy of the technical, smart voice of TechSNAP. In this sense, to me, it was my weekly appointment with the other people who know my job and are super smart and who will give me real technical explanations (but do so frequently in language and with a clarity and simplicity of organized thought that I could show segments to non techniocal girlfriends and they could easily understand)... and that's not even a tenth of why the show was so brilliant, so important, so invaluable, and such a wonderful creation...  \nI could go on and on (and might in a more formal open farewell letter, possibly posted as a column later this week), but Master Jude and ChrisLAS: Thanks so much for six wonderful years and hundreds of hours of the best, smartest, funniest, accurate, astute, and informative shows covering the *real* world of systems/network admin and engineering. \"TechSNAP\" stands without parallel as the finest program to cover such material, and its voice and tone and format and brilliance will be the high water mark that future programs will aspire to match, only to ultimately find that the ferocious brilliance of Jude's infallible cybernetic Canadian quantum-processing data-brain and Chris Fisher's spectacular, broadcast-strong (TV-grade, but even better, Internet compatible) hair were powerful, mostly pants-less, artifacts whose magical brilliance will never be rivaled by any IT contractor wandering the Internet without a clipboard and a sport coat. TechSNAP spoke with a great, pleasant, accurate, and brilliant voice that was a beacon extolling the virtues of computer science and IT using the real language to explain the real details until the concept could be really understood. In matters scientific, technical, as well as the news stories of the day, it explained without apologies and without compromise. Thanks guys: truly, you were the absolute best. \n\nHere's one of my favorite clips from vintage TechSnap: \nhttp://sethflynnbarkan.com/node/18","url":"https://soundcloud.com/fingersflynn/blgp-116-time-to-die-butcher-gonner-nerd-reviewed","date":{"$date":"2017-01-14T20:27:41.000Z"}}

WITH A STICK","description":"This week's monumental episode of the BLGP marks two new landmark's in the show's decades-long-history of sober, sane, thoughtful critical analysis and balanced, rational reflective commentary we've brought to you each and every episode, lo these hundred and thirty two point seven years of the show... FIRST: We add a third piece of all-time worst game copy to ever masquerade hollowly as a game's Steam store descriptive blurd - and yes, we explore this topic in depth, in spite of ourselves - hear all about \"Soda Girls\" and it's wondrously... zen-koan/Dylan Thomas-esque/cryptic insane prophecy derived from an arkane religious cult: with every reading, deeper layers, more cosmically complete, yet entirely defying concrete meaning or analysis seems to reveal themselves... Astonishing. \nSECOND on our show landmarks this week, as described above, this week we are running the most out of control, hyperbolically angry, and entirely furiously negative to the point of barbaric in irrational, howling hatred of one of the games we have *EVER* spent so little time actually playing before reviewing. Maybe not the most sane and purely objective review ever to run with our official seal of approval, unless someone provides me with any good argument that refutes or causes me to reconsider my position and premises in critiquing, \"Satellite Rush,\" I am currently standing by the furious diatribe of vitriolic fury and intellectual savagery of my review - if only for the simple fact that, I feel it does adequately make the point (and provides sufficient emphasis for it be the key take-away of our review) that \"Satellite Rush\" must be avoided, and should not be allowed to infect other sentient creatures with its unholy, endemic, radioactive plague of abject essence of \"fucking awful.\" So, until the laws of time, space, and rational thought undergo massive cosmic alterations, I'm sticking to it. And of course, if anything, it may be entertaining to any and all who grow weary of my pretty stolid policy of trying to focus on the positive in the titles we cover: this is most certaintly a REMARKABLY NOTICEABLE departure from our average, rosy, and cheery tone.\nBEST LINUX GAMES COLUMN will be up later tonight (as we hadn't anticipated our thoughts regarding the title we reviewed this week to so prolifically dominate the episode, thus, our subject for the column also had to change... currently, we have team of non-destroyed, non-furious, synapses working as fast as possible to get a new column up for this week). You can always find BLGtC(!!) on our website, at the top of the homepage, hiding deceptively under the hyperlink attached to the deliberately misleading text reading \"Best Linux Games Column\"\nFinally, one super special note of profound super-ultra thanks to friend of the show (and prolific genius of profound technical evil wizardry), the nfmz1, who was gracious enough to take an hour for us to pepper him with insane nonsequiters of rants pretending to be excellent interview questions. In spite of ourselves, the nfmz1's answers and thoughts are so powerfully brilliant as to survive even the onslought of a poorly planned, terribly slipshod, and unfortunately timed interview. Stay tuned for that feature next week!\n\nwww.bestlinuxgames.com\n... and remember the inscruitable demi-wisdom from one of the sacred tennants of \"Soda Girls:\" \"every enemy should be played carefully.\"","url":"https://soundcloud.com/fingersflynn/blgp-ep-108-beat-the-satellite-rush-with-a-stick","date":{"$date":"2016-11-19T23:17:09.000Z"}}

I liked a lot things that Solus brought to the table like how some of the games in there Software Center like \u0026#39;Xonotic\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;Witch Blast\u0026#39; which are games I normally install manually are available and up to date. I had trouble with usage of my generic gamepads as the system would not see them at all meanwhile on Lubuntu and Ubuntu Mate they were found without issue. While my Logitech F310 gamepads were found and worked flawlessly, my other ones did not. My hori fighting pads being the ones that proved most difficult. I also could not get Mednafen \u0026amp; Mednaffe working properly even after compile was successful. Some games would run slow randomly. This is my emulator of choice for my NGPC collection and has served me well all these years. There were some small edits that I had to make like assigning keyboard shortcut to terminal and saving my xorg conf file for no screen tearing on my Nvidia rigs using sudo text edits while on other distros it was automatically generated. Overall I liked Solus but for me it\u0026#39;s not quite there yet.

Shouldn\u0026#39;t it ignore the linux desktop mouse settings and using raw input then? Maybe I\u0026#39;m wrong.I repeat, I use libinput because in my distro there is no way to switch back to evdev.

To start with, it has you pick a control scheme (you can change it any time) and there\u0026#39;s quite a good variety here to please different types of gamers. You can go with keyboard and mouse, keyboard only, twin-stick gamepad or even \u0026quot;classic\u0026quot; gamepad that\u0026#39;s more like a traditional platformer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eNote\u003c/u\u003e: Key provided by the developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"youtube-embed-wrapper\" data-video-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pEUGziYzygA?rel=0\" style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pEUGziYzygA?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRifter is a game that will at times fill you with rage. Failure after failure, with completely miss-timed hooks, enemies to take your attention away making you fall into water, lasers and so on. It\u0026#39;s a mad experience, one I\u0026#39;ve had quite a lot of fun with overall. The sound track is fantastic too, it just keeps going on getting you pumped up for whatever\u0026#39;s coming next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you progress, it gradually changes the environment while it adds in more enemies and environmental obstacles to create a rather varied and tough experience. It\u0026#39;s usually pretty fair, there\u0026#39;s only been a few times where I genuinely thought the game was trying to make me flip a table over. Thankfully, you also get access to upgrades as well to give you an extra speed boost when using your hook, the ability to climb ledges and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the levels are really quite insane for the amount of different mechanics they throw you through. You\u0026#39;re jumping, swinging, dashing, grabbing onto things that propel you in a direction while avoiding enemies locked onto you, enemies that can fire at you and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4596732351531397623gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4596732351531397623gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKey Features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLightning-fast acrobatic platformer -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eRun, swing, smash and dash and feel exhilarating freedom of movement\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnlock, upgrade, discover -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eRift through over 90 levels, 30 upgrades, new skills and leaderboards\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSynthwave infused hypnotic style -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eGet in the zone with a pumping 80s synthwave soundtrack \u0026amp; neon-drenched visuals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFace massive bosses -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eChallenge a large variety of enemy types and hard-as-nails boss fights\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReveal the mysteries behind Rifter -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eNot everything is as it seems.

From those data I could quite conveniently calculate prices for the graphic cards. So I decided to do a small analysis.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMy main two questions I wanted to answer were what is better in terms of price-performance(fps). AMD or Nvidia. The second question was how does the price affect performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI chose a very simple methodology - log-log linear regression model (a linear regression on logarithmized price and fps) done in R.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFirst, here is the results for ln(fps)~ln(price)+vendor:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eCall: lm(formula = ln.fps ~ ln.price + chip, data = data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.23216 -0.50646 0.01925 0.41168 2.27799 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

However it is important to note that this coefficient is deemed insignificant at any reasonable confidence, so it could be said that They perform almost identically. The second interesting value is that for every 1\u0026#37; increase in the price, you\u0026#39;d get 0.631\u0026#37; increase in fps on average.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSince the vendor variable came out as insignificant, I tried to run the model again without it.

The post is written by\u0026nbsp;Rob Wyatt, the\u0026nbsp;System Architect for the Atari VCS device. If the name Rob Wyatt doesn\u0026#39;t ring a bell\u0026mdash;they were the original\u0026nbsp;Xbox\u0026nbsp;system architect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/tagline_images/563908150id12143gol.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, they\u0026#39;ve decided to upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, which gives it quite bit more room to breathe. Quite a lot of games require more RAM now, so that\u0026#39;s good. Not expecting it to run some AAA games, but it\u0026#39;s still a nice step forward for the device:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe VCS hardware will be powered by an AMD Bristol Ridge family APU with Radeon R7 graphics and is now going to get 8 gigabytes of unified memory. This is a huge upgrade from what was originally specified and unlike other consoles it\u0026rsquo;s all available, we won\u0026rsquo;t reserve 25% of hardware resources for system use.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also explained why they went with\u0026nbsp;Bristol Ridge instead of Ryzen:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, on paper the Ryzen family is technically better but without increasing the cost and having a higher thermal capacity, a Ryzen APU would never run at full performance. When the Ryzen is operating in a thermally limited environment its performance is only marginally better than Bristol Ridge.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#39;re calling their version of Linux \u0026quot;AtariOS\u0026quot;. To get a game to run on the Atari VCS, you need to ensure it \u0026quot;runs on Linux at HD resolution using standard runtime libraries\u0026quot; as they claim\u0026nbsp;the changes will be minimal in getting it to support their hardware. This is really great, since it certainly could push a few extra developers towards getting their games on Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a game\u0026nbsp;supports Linux, it gains access to more traditional Linux distributions via Steam, GOG, itch and others as well as the Atari VCS now too. I just hope that developers don\u0026#39;t end up only putting their games on the VCS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s really interesting as well, is their explanation of\u0026nbsp;how you can run another Linux distribution alongside their official\u0026nbsp;AtariOS:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur core architecture consists of the Atari Secure Hypervisor and a heavily modified linux kernel called the AtariOS. All of this is in flash memory and before the AtariOS loads, any external storage device is checked, and if a bootable device is found, the OtherOS on that device is loaded instead. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a typical OS loader like UBoot or GRUB, and because the CPU is already in 64 bit protected mode from our boot code, the OtherOS will need its typical startup code changing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a Linux distribution loaded in their OtherOS mode, it will have full access to the hardware so it will be a proper Linux device that is \u003cu\u003eyours\u003c/u\u003e. They say they will give out details on how to boot a standard Ubuntu distribution on it, so that\u0026#39;s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis line also got me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe never want to lose sight that it\u0026rsquo;s your hardware to do with as you want.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWords I hope they remember to stick by. An interesting blog post, that has certainly cleared up a few of my lingering worries about the device.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey managed to raise just shy of three million on their \u003ca href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/atari-vcs-game-stream-connect-like-never-before-family-computers#/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIndieGoGo\u003c/a\u003e campaign, which seems like an impressive number, but likely not close to the real cost of getting this device past the prototype stage, manufactured and actually out in your hands.

the framerates and compares those, but a better way would be to compare each test then find the average of those. That would show that the 580 averages 23\u0026#37; more FPS than the 1060, while the 1070 averages 11\u0026#37; more FPS than the 580.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome random thoughts …\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI came into this thinking of GTX 1060 and RX 580 as being equivalent, despite knowing that the latter tended to win benchmarks on Linux, but this data suggests that the AMD card is actually slightly closer to a GTX 1070.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 1060 beats the 580 in 3 out of 43 tests, while the 580 beats the 1070 in 8 of the tests. The differences for individual games range from very close to huge so this isn\u0026#39;t a very useful comparison, but does show that the scales tip from GeForce to Radeon as resolution increases.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDota 2 is faster in OpenGL at 1080p than in Vulkan but this flips at higher resolutions. I\u0026#39;m not sure how to reconcile this with the expectation that Vulkan helps with CPU bottlenecks. Perhaps it is something to do with the intense optimisation they did leading up to the Steam Machine launch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI know that frame time, maximum or 95th percentile or similar, is a better measure than average frame rate.
