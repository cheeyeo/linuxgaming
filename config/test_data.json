So I went to the website and checked, and I was right, it says the stable version is 3.0.2 and the dev version is 3.12. However I googled some more and then I found update notes for versions 3.9 and 3.8, and now I\u0026#39;m just confused as hell, what are these versions? what\u0026#39;s the latest one I\u0026#39;m supposed to use?

No other program or podcast made real system administrators and those working in networking or systems design and deployment or any variety of technical, lonely, misunderstood, and isolating thankless difficult IT positions spoke to its audience using the same clear, totally unshy of the technical, smart voice of TechSNAP. In this sense, to me, it was my weekly appointment with the other people who know my job and are super smart and who will give me real technical explanations (but do so frequently in language and with a clarity and simplicity of organized thought that I could show segments to non techniocal girlfriends and they could easily understand)... and that's not even a tenth of why the show was so brilliant, so important, so invaluable, and such a wonderful creation...  \nI could go on and on (and might in a more formal open farewell letter, possibly posted as a column later this week), but Master Jude and ChrisLAS: Thanks so much for six wonderful years and hundreds of hours of the best, smartest, funniest, accurate, astute, and informative shows covering the *real* world of systems/network admin and engineering. \"TechSNAP\" stands without parallel as the finest program to cover such material, and its voice and tone and format and brilliance will be the high water mark that future programs will aspire to match, only to ultimately find that the ferocious brilliance of Jude's infallible cybernetic Canadian quantum-processing data-brain and Chris Fisher's spectacular, broadcast-strong (TV-grade, but even better, Internet compatible) hair were powerful, mostly pants-less, artifacts whose magical brilliance will never be rivaled by any IT contractor wandering the Internet without a clipboard and a sport coat. TechSNAP spoke with a great, pleasant, accurate, and brilliant voice that was a beacon extolling the virtues of computer science and IT using the real language to explain the real details until the concept could be really understood. In matters scientific, technical, as well as the news stories of the day, it explained without apologies and without compromise.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b460cb7f6bdd84c90014ecc"},"name":"BLGP","title":"BLGP EP 108: Beat The (Satellite) Rush... WITH A STICK","description":"This week's monumental episode of the BLGP marks two new landmark's in the show's decades-long-history of sober, sane, thoughtful critical analysis and balanced, rational reflective commentary we've brought to you each and every episode, lo these hundred and thirty two point seven years of the show... FIRST: We add a third piece of all-time worst game copy to ever masquerade hollowly as a game's Steam store descriptive blurd - and yes, we explore this topic in depth, in spite of ourselves - hear all about \"Soda Girls\" and it's wondrously... zen-koan/Dylan Thomas-esque/cryptic insane prophecy derived from an arkane religious cult: with every reading, deeper layers, more cosmically complete, yet entirely defying concrete meaning or analysis seems to reveal themselves... Astonishing. \nSECOND on our show landmarks this week, as described above, this week we are running the most out of control, hyperbolically angry, and entirely furiously negative to the point of barbaric in irrational, howling hatred of one of the games we have *EVER* spent so little time actually playing before reviewing. Maybe not the most sane and purely objective review ever to run with our official seal of approval, unless someone provides me with any good argument that refutes or causes me to reconsider my position and premises in critiquing, \"Satellite Rush,\" I am currently standing by the furious diatribe of vitriolic fury and intellectual savagery of my review - if only for the simple fact that, I feel it does adequately make the point (and provides sufficient emphasis for it be the key take-away of our review) that \"Satellite Rush\" must be avoided, and should not be allowed to infect other sentient creatures with its unholy, endemic, radioactive plague of abject essence of \"fucking awful.\" So, until the laws of time, space, and rational thought undergo massive cosmic alterations, I'm sticking to it. And of course, if anything, it may be entertaining to any and all who grow weary of my pretty stolid policy of trying to focus on the positive in the titles we cover: this is most certaintly a REMARKABLY NOTICEABLE departure from our average, rosy, and cheery tone.\nBEST LINUX GAMES COLUMN will be up later tonight (as we hadn't anticipated our thoughts regarding the title we reviewed this week to so prolifically dominate the episode, thus, our subject for the column also had to change... currently, we have team of non-destroyed, non-furious, synapses working as fast as possible to get a new column up for this week). You can always find BLGtC(!!) on our website, at the top of the homepage, hiding deceptively under the hyperlink attached to the deliberately misleading text reading \"Best Linux Games Column\"\nFinally, one super special note of profound super-ultra thanks to friend of the show (and prolific genius of profound technical evil wizardry), the nfmz1, who was gracious enough to take an hour for us to pepper him with insane nonsequiters of rants pretending to be excellent interview questions. In spite of ourselves, the nfmz1's answers and thoughts are so powerfully brilliant as to survive even the onslought of a poorly planned, terribly slipshod, and unfortunately timed interview. Stay tuned for that feature next week!\n\nwww.bestlinuxgames.com\n... and remember the inscruitable demi-wisdom from one of the sacred tennants of \"Soda Girls:\" \"every enemy should be played carefully.\"","url":"https://soundcloud.com/fingersflynn/blgp-ep-108-beat-the-satellite-rush-with-a-stick","type":"podcast","date":{"$date":"2016-11-19T23:17:09.000Z"}}

I liked a lot things that Solus brought to the table like how some of the games in there Software Center like \u0026#39;Xonotic\u0026#39; and \u0026#39;Witch Blast\u0026#39; which are games I normally install manually are available and up to date. I had trouble with usage of my generic gamepads as the system would not see them at all meanwhile on Lubuntu and Ubuntu Mate they were found without issue. While my Logitech F310 gamepads were found and worked flawlessly, my other ones did not. My hori fighting pads being the ones that proved most difficult. I also could not get Mednafen \u0026amp; Mednaffe working properly even after compile was successful. Some games would run slow randomly. This is my emulator of choice for my NGPC collection and has served me well all these years. There were some small edits that I had to make like assigning keyboard shortcut to terminal and saving my xorg conf file for no screen tearing on my Nvidia rigs using sudo text edits while on other distros it was automatically generated. Overall I liked Solus but for me it\u0026#39;s not quite there yet. I will continue to check on the project and I added it to my Patreon to continue to support it as I like the direction it\u0026#39;s going in.

The second is another occational freeze when alt-tabbing but something that can be prevented by using windowed mode.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eBut the third.

Shouldn\u0026#39;t it ignore the linux desktop mouse settings and using raw input then? Maybe I\u0026#39;m wrong.I repeat, I use libinput because in my distro there is no way to switch back to evdev.

To start with, it has you pick a control scheme (you can change it any time) and there\u0026#39;s quite a good variety here to please different types of gamers. You can go with keyboard and mouse, keyboard only, twin-stick gamepad or even \u0026quot;classic\u0026quot; gamepad that\u0026#39;s more like a traditional platformer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cu\u003eNote\u003c/u\u003e: Key provided by the developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"youtube-embed-wrapper\" data-video-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pEUGziYzygA?rel=0\" style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pEUGziYzygA?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRifter is a game that will at times fill you with rage. Failure after failure, with completely miss-timed hooks, enemies to take your attention away making you fall into water, lasers and so on. It\u0026#39;s a mad experience, one I\u0026#39;ve had quite a lot of fun with overall. The sound track is fantastic too, it just keeps going on getting you pumped up for whatever\u0026#39;s coming next.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs you progress, it gradually changes the environment while it adds in more enemies and environmental obstacles to create a rather varied and tough experience. It\u0026#39;s usually pretty fair, there\u0026#39;s only been a few times where I genuinely thought the game was trying to make me flip a table over. Thankfully, you also get access to upgrades as well to give you an extra speed boost when using your hook, the ability to climb ledges and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the levels are really quite insane for the amount of different mechanics they throw you through. You\u0026#39;re jumping, swinging, dashing, grabbing onto things that propel you in a direction while avoiding enemies locked onto you, enemies that can fire at you and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4596732351531397623gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4596732351531397623gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eKey Features:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLightning-fast acrobatic platformer -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eRun, swing, smash and dash and feel exhilarating freedom of movement\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnlock, upgrade, discover -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eRift through over 90 levels, 30 upgrades, new skills and leaderboards\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSynthwave infused hypnotic style -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eGet in the zone with a pumping 80s synthwave soundtrack \u0026amp; neon-drenched visuals\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFace massive bosses -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eChallenge a large variety of enemy types and hard-as-nails boss fights\u003c/li\u003e\n\u0009\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReveal the mysteries behind Rifter -\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eNot everything is as it seems.

The post is written by\u0026nbsp;Rob Wyatt, the\u0026nbsp;System Architect for the Atari VCS device. If the name Rob Wyatt doesn\u0026#39;t ring a bell\u0026mdash;they were the original\u0026nbsp;Xbox\u0026nbsp;system architect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/tagline_images/563908150id12143gol.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, they\u0026#39;ve decided to upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, which gives it quite bit more room to breathe. Quite a lot of games require more RAM now, so that\u0026#39;s good. Not expecting it to run some AAA games, but it\u0026#39;s still a nice step forward for the device:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe VCS hardware will be powered by an AMD Bristol Ridge family APU with Radeon R7 graphics and is now going to get 8 gigabytes of unified memory. This is a huge upgrade from what was originally specified and unlike other consoles it\u0026rsquo;s all available, we won\u0026rsquo;t reserve 25% of hardware resources for system use.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey also explained why they went with\u0026nbsp;Bristol Ridge instead of Ryzen:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYes, on paper the Ryzen family is technically better but without increasing the cost and having a higher thermal capacity, a Ryzen APU would never run at full performance. When the Ryzen is operating in a thermally limited environment its performance is only marginally better than Bristol Ridge.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#39;re calling their version of Linux \u0026quot;AtariOS\u0026quot;. To get a game to run on the Atari VCS, you need to ensure it \u0026quot;runs on Linux at HD resolution using standard runtime libraries\u0026quot; as they claim\u0026nbsp;the changes will be minimal in getting it to support their hardware. This is really great, since it certainly could push a few extra developers towards getting their games on Linux.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce a game\u0026nbsp;supports Linux, it gains access to more traditional Linux distributions via Steam, GOG, itch and others as well as the Atari VCS now too. I just hope that developers don\u0026#39;t end up only putting their games on the VCS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s really interesting as well, is their explanation of\u0026nbsp;how you can run another Linux distribution alongside their official\u0026nbsp;AtariOS:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOur core architecture consists of the Atari Secure Hypervisor and a heavily modified linux kernel called the AtariOS. All of this is in flash memory and before the AtariOS loads, any external storage device is checked, and if a bootable device is found, the OtherOS on that device is loaded instead. We don\u0026rsquo;t have a typical OS loader like UBoot or GRUB, and because the CPU is already in 64 bit protected mode from our boot code, the OtherOS will need its typical startup code changing.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a Linux distribution loaded in their OtherOS mode, it will have full access to the hardware so it will be a proper Linux device that is \u003cu\u003eyours\u003c/u\u003e. They say they will give out details on how to boot a standard Ubuntu distribution on it, so that\u0026#39;s great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis line also got me:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe never want to lose sight that it\u0026rsquo;s your hardware to do with as you want.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWords I hope they remember to stick by.

the framerates and compares those, but a better way would be to compare each test then find the average of those. That would show that the 580 averages 23\u0026#37; more FPS than the 1060, while the 1070 averages 11\u0026#37; more FPS than the 580.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSome random thoughts …\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI came into this thinking of GTX 1060 and RX 580 as being equivalent, despite knowing that the latter tended to win benchmarks on Linux, but this data suggests that the AMD card is actually slightly closer to a GTX 1070.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe 1060 beats the 580 in 3 out of 43 tests, while the 580 beats the 1070 in 8 of the tests. The differences for individual games range from very close to huge so this isn\u0026#39;t a very useful comparison, but does show that the scales tip from GeForce to Radeon as resolution increases.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDota 2 is faster in OpenGL at 1080p than in Vulkan but this flips at higher resolutions. I\u0026#39;m not sure how to reconcile this with the expectation that Vulkan helps with CPU bottlenecks. Perhaps it is something to do with the intense optimisation they did leading up to the Steam Machine launch.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI know that frame time, maximum or 95th percentile or similar, is a better measure than average frame rate.

By default Lutris puts my library in ~/.local/share/lutris/runners/winesteam. Because my root SSD is only 80GB, I need it to be stored in the Games partition of my second hard drive, which is mounted at ~/.bin/Games. Can I just add another library location within Wine Steam, or would that mess things up? I tried changing the location in the runner settings, but that didn\u0026#39;t seem to do anything.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- SC_ON --\u003e \u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Creepynerd_\"\u003e /u/Creepynerd_ \u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8zpubr/how_to_change_wine_steam_library_in_lutris/\"\u003e[link]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u0026#32; \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8zpubr/how_to_change_wine_steam_library_in_lutris/\"\u003e[comments]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/8zpubr/how_to_change_wine_steam_library_in_lutris/","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-07-17T22:38:19.000Z"}}

Fixed a bug that could cause multi-threaded EGL applications to crash when exiting. Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels. Fixed an intermittent hang of Vulkan applications running fullscreen when flipping is allowed. Removed informational messages that were printed by nvidia- modeset.ko whenever a GPU device was allocated or freed. Fixed a bug that could cause kernel panics when using Quadro SDI Capture hardware. Fixed a bug that caused kwin OpenGL compositing to crash when launching certain OpenGL applications. Fixed an intermittent crash when launching Vulkan applications. Fixed an intermittent crash when launching applications through Wine. Fixed a bug that caused the driver, in some low bandwidth DisplayPort configurations, to not implicitly enable display dithering. This resulted in visible banding. Fixed intermittent hangs of fullscreen Vulkan applications when focused away (e.g., by using the alt-tab key combination) on non- composited desktops. Increased the version numbers of the GLVND libGL, libGLESv1_CM, libGLESv2, and libEGL libraries, to prevent concurrently installed non-GLVND libraries from taking precedence in the dynamic linker cache. Updated the OpenGL driver to allow the use of integer format (SINT/UINT) color attachments with depth attachments in Frame Buffer Objects. \u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- SC_ON --\u003e \u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/catulirdit\"\u003e /u/catulirdit \u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/9093c2/nvidia_drivers_39645_released/\"\u003e[link]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u0026#32; \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/9093c2/nvidia_drivers_39645_released/\"\u003e[comments]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/9093c2/nvidia_drivers_39645_released/","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-07-19T19:44:58.000Z"}}

It\u0026rsquo;s something of a cross between a more traditional real time strategy title and a city builder, as commanding units and building up your settlement and resources are important. It\u0026rsquo;s also a fairly fun game from my limited time with it and has both a story-rich campaign and multiplayer content to enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Clan of the Snake joins the other factions in-game as part of paid DLC, adding a few unique mechanics and buildings. Unlike other clans, they don\u0026rsquo;t make use of Fame and have abilities that help with disrupting foes by targeting their economy and keeping them off balance. They\u0026rsquo;re even capable of stealing the unique Lore (technology) from other clans for their own tree. Finally, they\u0026rsquo;re led by Signy, whose abilities become stronger as the seasons pass and she grows older.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe patch that release alongside the DLC has a few goodies for everyone as well. Most noticeably, there\u0026rsquo;s a new unit\u0026mdash;the skirmisher. As the name implies, these are light units that aren\u0026rsquo;t very good in a head-on fight but make up for that deficiency with superior speed and the ability to pass by wildlife without being seen. Aside from that there\u0026rsquo;s quite a few balance changes and improvemetns such as better military management for the AI and buffs to certain buildings and powers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSee the full patch notes and DLC details \u003ca href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/466560/announcements/detail/1689297920455616586\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can grab Northgard and the Clan of the Snake DLC on \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;or \u003ca href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/store/northgard?partner=gamingonlinux\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHumble Store\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/northgard-introduces-the-clan-of-the-snake-in-a-new-dlc.12191","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-07-21T18:46:50.000Z"}}

I\u0026#39;ve been able to get PRIME working with all my games (long story short, I\u0026#39;m using Kernel 4.18 rc5, AMD vega M firmware, and Mesa 18.1.4).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Vega M is actually a great GPU for 1080p gaming, and I\u0026#39;ve been able to run lots of games using DXVK + Lutris, but Minecraft continued to use my integrated Intel GPU.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eMost of the time using the discrete GPU is as simple as adding \u003ccode\u003eenv DRI_PRIME=1\u003c/code\u003e before the command - or in Lutris, you simply have check the checkbox enabling PRIME.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, with Minecraft there is a separate launcher, and starting the launcher with a given set of environment variables \u003cstrong\u003edoes not pass these environment variables\u003c/strong\u003e to the java executable which runs minecraft. With older versions of Minecraft you could simply run \u003ccode\u003eenv DRI_PRIME=1 java -jar /path/to/minecraft.jar\u003c/code\u003e, but that is no longer an option now as the launcher performs validation of your credentials when attempting to run the game.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThere is also no way to set environment variables from within the launcher itself, which royally sucks.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo after wracking my brain on how to solve this problem, an idea come to me. In the advanced options in the launcher you can specify a custom Java executable.

Back in 2008, i discovered that a computer didnt have to look the same as the neighbors, so out of curiosity i installed Ubuntu 8.10 on the main rig in the house (Pentium D, 8500gt, 512mb RAM) and I loved the opennes, speed and mostly driverless hassle of linux (specially printer-wise in an XP era).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI got into many open-source or free games available.

Sure, everything is now nautical but much of the same charm and sensibilities (not to mention aesthetics) are clearly meant to evoke parallels with that adventure. Set in the 18th century, The Caribbean Sail has you fill the role of the captain of a ship with the premise that great riches await those who sail and make it all the way to far-off Nassau.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough the Caribbean port of Nassau might seem like the final target, much like Oregon is in Oregon Trail, the game turns out to be a far more open and non-linear affair than that. In reality, you\u0026rsquo;re free to sail about to different ports, amassing wealth and improving your ship as you go along. In the course of your adventures you can become a commissioned privateer, a pirate, or get caught up in the global conflicts of the time. This is one of the strongest parts of the game and there\u0026rsquo;s mechanics such as being able to change up your flag and fool enemies or friends that are fun little details that allow you really play as you like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/13579220161532302551gol1294.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/13579220161532302551gol1294.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThough most ports are in the Atlantic, far off India and China can also be reached\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eEvery time a port is reached, players receive experience which can unlock new ship types, captain types and other assorted awards. As your captain becomes more experienced, you may upgrade a few skills in order to improve your chances of surviving long journeys out at sea. I think the game mostly strikes the right balance between simplistic and engaging when it comes to these systems and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of replayability found in trying out different combinations or simply sailing around to different ports without a specific goal in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome of the minigame segments, like fishing or fighting battles, can be a little too simplistic and repetitive due to the amount of times you have to do them. They\u0026rsquo;re not very challenging but screwing up in them can have disastrous consequences without, conversely, giving you that much feeling of accomplishment. Clicking the mouse to launch a harpoon at the right moment becomes almost second nature eventually but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t excuse the dozens of clicks you have to do on a long journey in order to have enough food for your crew.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/252818381532302552gol1294.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/252818381532302552gol1294.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere\u0026#39;s always a malingerer in every crew\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI know the retro look is polarizing to many gamers but if you\u0026rsquo;re into that sort of thing, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that the game paid a lot of attention to the details of it all. The various midi-like sea shanties you can collect and play, the flags, art of the ports and other things all feel very much \u003cem\u003eright\u003c/em\u003e and fit right in with that aesthetic from begone eras. Likewise, care went into the small things like having Portuguese man o\u0026rsquo; wars appear in the Central Atlantic or Narwhals in the waters around Iceland.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to find and to enjoy in the game and it\u0026rsquo;s likely impossible to experience it all in a single session. You can expect to run into the occasional wreck, flotsam or reef as you\u0026rsquo;re sailing along. Or you may find yourself dealing with mutineers or debating whether or not to saw off a wounded limb on a crewmember after battle. Even something like figuring out how to best use the special items you can pick up at ports or trade for with other ships is something that\u0026#39;ll take you a while. The bits of cheeky humor sprinkled in here and there help matters and, more importantly, struck the right chord with me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy only criticism in regards to these events and random discoveries is that I wish that there was more of them, perhaps occurring more frequently. Some parts of each game, especially after you\u0026rsquo;ve aligned with a faction, can feel a little cookie cutter with much of the gameplay boiling down to sailing to a specific port in order to try to find a specific ship to sink. So having a little more variety aside from spotting another ship and choosing to engage it or not could have helped break up some of the unintentional tedium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4873874291532302551gol1294.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4873874291532302551gol1294.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the technical side of things, I did have an issue starting up the game. I believe it\u0026rsquo;s the same bug that currently affects all GameMaker Studio titles on systems running the Mesa drivers which can be worked around by using only software rendering. As these titles tend to be simple 2d games, most modern CPUs can handle doing so just fine. I added the following to my launch options in Steam:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"background:#eeeeee;border:1px solid #cccccc;padding:5px 10px;\"\u003eLIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 %command%\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I had fun exploring the vast oceans and (usually) dying a terrible death at the hands of a powerful warship or due to infection. It certainly respects the spirit of The Oregon Trail while not being exactly beholden to the formula and is all the more fun because of it. If you\u0026rsquo;re into the idea of an open-ended adventure and don\u0026rsquo;t mind just a little drudgery now and again, then this is an easy title to recommend. I can definitely see myself coming back to this every now and again and trying my luck once more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find The Caribbean Sail on \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/657690/The_Caribbean_Sail/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/sailing-the-ocean-blue-and-dealing-with-pirates-some-thoughts-on-the-caribbean-sail.12194","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-07-22T23:49:52.000Z"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b55b53a835ac38de9f75ed2"},"name":"linux_gaming","title":"Switched from GTX1060 to RX580 - Worse Performance","description":"\u003c!-- SC_OFF --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"md\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was doing a little bit of graphics card musical-chairs and thought I\u0026#39;d replace the GPU in my Linux gaming box with a RX580 due to the current benchmarks and so fourth (as well as all the praise of how much better it is to use these days than the evil Nvidia drivers). Unfortunately it\u0026#39;s not gone as well as hoped:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe first issue is that I\u0026#39;ve found performance is a bit worse. Unfortunately I only have one saved benchmark to hand right now so I\u0026#39;ll use that as the example, but Unigine Valley went from 2559 with the 1060, to 2229 with the 580. That\u0026#39;s more shocking given that the 1060 was a pretty basic version of the card where as the 580 is one of the fastest (Sapphire Nitro+ SE).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe second issue, and despite how weird it sounds, is actually considerably more of a problem for me. The machine is normally used with a projector when it\u0026#39;s being used for gaming, but I often work on it remotely or even play games remotely from it. In the latter instances the projector is off. That was fine with the Nvidia card but it\u0026#39;s not with the AMD card. To elaborate on the issue: With the Nvidia card, it could see the projector connected even if it was turned off (which is how EDID is supposed to work). Xrandr would show all the projectors supported video modes and refresh rates. With the AMD card, everything disappears as soon as the projector is turned off, xrandr shows nothing and I get dropped to a basic 1024x768@1Hz emergency fallback XOrg resolution. This obviously breaks everything and makes it unusable (and impossible to work on remotely). Does anyone know why the AMD card acts this way and cannot see the display even though it\u0026#39;s still physically connected? (albeit not turned on).\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFootnote: Versions - Linux 4.17.8, Mesa 18.1.4, LLVM 6.0.1.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEDIT/FIX for the second issue\u003c/strong\u003e: So the issue is the new DC code. As both AsciiWolf and Aru21 suspected, the new DC code (amdgpu.dc=1) is at fault. Forcing this off with amdgpu.dc=0 on the kernel boot line fixes the issue (although I\u0026#39;m not sure if that in itself creates any new problems...).

Given all the features it has, it takes up so little space on my desk I\u0026#39;m really quite surprised by it. It measures only 450mm x 170mm x 40mm so it\u0026#39;s really not big at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/11672474831532359596gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/11672474831532359596gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s actually cheaper than my previous Roccat keyboard too, so that\u0026#39;s a bit of a bonus. The Corsair also comes with edged/patterned WASD keys (which I decided to use), with W/A/D\u0026nbsp;having a slight ramp on the side to stop you slipping off them\u0026mdash;surprisingly useful for FPS games. It has similar keys you can use for a few other keys as well. The keys were really easy to change around with the look hook it gives you, which was really great as I don\u0026#39;t like small fiddly things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also lock the super key (the Windows key) by pressing the top right button, which is surprisingly useful when you don\u0026#39;t want accidentally bring up some sort of desktop HUD when you\u0026#39;re in a particularly intense gaming session.

It\u0026#39;s quiet, sure, but still audible enough so that you\u0026#39;re still aware you\u0026#39;re typing. Absolute silence would be a little bit weird, but it\u0026#39;s a much duller sound that isn\u0026#39;t irritating which makes it great to use for long periods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can easily tell the difference too, listen to the audio embed below with the load clicker Roccat, then after a second or two of silence the Corsair and you will hear for yourself how much nicer it is:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"ckeditor-html5-audio\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003caudio controls=\"controls\" src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4882006561532345385gol1.mp3\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/audio\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI actually cranked up the gain on my microphone for that test too, so it\u0026#39;s quite impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor those of you who like to play your games in a dark room, but don\u0026#39;t want to be blinded by your keyboard, the Corsair also features multiple brightness settings at the touch a button (including off).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn terms of other features:\u0026nbsp;it has a single USB port on the back, a few function key shortcuts like volume, play, pause and so on, anti-ghosting and naturally you can customize how the lights work really easily on Linux thanks to the open source ckb-next [\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e] driver and UI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ckb-next project is not an official Corsair product, but another great example of how open source is great.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/3093779331532337505gol1.png\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/3093779331532337505gol1.png\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;ve not had a single issue with\u0026nbsp;ckb-next personally, messing around with profiles, animations and so on is an absolutely breeze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s been a fantastic experience with it so far.

The studio and publisher just got your money and don\u0026#39;t care one whit that you\u0026#39;re running under WINE. You may well be one game patch away from not being able to run it as most of the studios and publishers have no qualms whatsoever in breaking you. EVE Online is an exception in that they\u0026#39;ve chosen to officially support us via that route. Many will remember the \u0026quot;fun\u0026quot; World of Warcraft players running under WINE had a while back. Once there was a bunch of flak, Blizzard changed their position on the whole affair- but until they got that pushback, they didn\u0026#39;t care one whit. To them, you\u0026#39;re supposed to be another Windows user, not a Linux user. Why would you want to enter into a relationship like that? Don\u0026#39;t get me wrong on WINE. I use it. I think it\u0026#39;s an amazing piece of software and I\u0026#39;m constantly impressed at what they DO manage to make work with it. It\u0026#39;s just more than a bit less than optimal for getting things to start happening for us in gaming when you use it as an answer for Linux gaming, in my not so humble opinion on the subject. Until the accountants and upper management of the publishers like Eidos, 2K Games, and EA see that we\u0026#39;re going to BUY a Linux version, we\u0026#39;re not going to see it from companies like theirs for a while yet to come.\u0026quot;\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFrank C.

There\u0026#39;s a few different ways to begin your terror, although you do need to beat the game using Bacteria first before unlocking things like a Virus, Fungus, Bio-Weapon and more. Once you\u0026#39;ve made your choice, you can also modify the genetic code with various additions, but these are also locked at the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce passed all that, you name it and pick a starting location. Naturally, my Sin-1 Bacteria started in England. Over time, you gradually accrue DNA points to evolve. You could make it so it gives more symptoms, improve it\u0026#39;s infection rate and also give it survival abilities like withstanding hot temperatures.

The upcoming original title developed by Cultic Games offers a mix of rich RPG world building and turn-based tactical combat for PC, Mac, and Linux, represented in an illustrative 2D visual style that manages to be both quaint and terrifying. Players will journey from a doomed Arkham into the depths of the Abyss, creating their own character based on one of eight Archetypes and carve a path through a broken and mysterious world. The desperate battle against the forces beyond our comprehension will haunt players until the end. The game\u0026rsquo;s unique Belief System mechanic determines how character sanity is affected by the warped reality and how sanity can be regenerated. It also affects the availability of dialog options, as well as their consequences, in a given situation. Physical combat will be challenging, spellcasting will have dire consequences, and sanity will be strained to the breaking point by unknown abominations. Sometimes the best solution will be to flee what lurks beyond the threshold.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThey\u0026#39;ve also shared some up to date screenshots (click to enlarge):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/10840904251532688445gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/10840904251532688445gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/3786494661532688445gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/3786494661532688445gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/9335754311532688445gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/9335754311532688445gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/17358033961532688445gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/17358033961532688445gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/232982481532688446gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/232982481532688446gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/16866791751532688446gol1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/thumbs/16866791751532688446gol1.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a demo, which sadly is not on Linux just yet.

Alright, a lot crap. - i7-2720QM processor with Intel HD 2000 graphics. I’ve had a bit of surgery lately, so while I’m resting up at my mum’s I thought I’d see if this game would work, give my something to do. It played okaaaay, but chugged fairly regularly and my laptop was running flat out.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI tried to change the resolution from full screen 1366x768 down to windowed 1280x720, and the game crashed.

Selecting yes or no didn’t help, and the only way out was to power cycle my laptop.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI tried verifying the game through Steam, uninstalling \u0026amp; reinstalling, uninstalling \u0026amp; reinstalling steam as well - none of these would revert the game to the default full screen 1366x768. Eventually I emailed Failbetter Games asking for help.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThey got back to me this morning asking for the “Player.log file”, which I sent off (folder: .config/unity3d/Failbetter Games/Sunless Sea/Player.log). While here, I noticed the file “prefs”. Inspecting this file showed three “Screenmanager is” fields: “Fullscreen mode”, “Resolution height” and “Resolution width”. The first was set to 0, the second to 32567 (or something similar) and the last to 1364.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI changed the fields to 1, 768 and 1366 - and the game works as it did when first installed! I assume there’s a bug somewhere when changing screen settings that has somehow overrun and written a maximum value for the “Resolution height” field. For now the game works, I just have to prop my laptop up to keep it cool and accept a few framerate dips :)\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eI’m waiting on Failbetter Games to get back to me in case they can get it working in a lower resolution for me, and in the meantime I found \u003ca href=\"http://www.aclockworkberry.com/managing-screen-resolution-and-aspect-ratio-in-unity-3d/\"\u003ethis (slightly outdated now) article\u003c/a\u003e which mentions a bug in unity3d related to Ubuntu 14.10.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSo yeah, check your preferences or configuration files if things are crashing - sometimes a little tinkering can get things going again.

There have been multiple updates to the game since then, adding \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/ships-choices-and-gods-some-more-thoughts-on-pillars-of-eternity-ii.11762\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efree content\u003c/a\u003e, bug and balance fixes as well as plenty of quality of life improvements and mod support.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBeast of Winter is the first batch of content that expands the game in any significant way and sees the Watcher venture forth to chilly southern seas and get caught up, in typical fashion, in events that could have repercussions for the whole of the world of Eora. If you\u0026rsquo;ve been paying any attention to the series\u0026rsquo; lore, the title of the DLC is a clear allusion to the god of entropy, Rymrgand, and the Watcher is set to deal with both his worshipers, his very cheery demeanor and disposition towards living beings. This is all very self-contained and all of the action is limited to the new area of Harbingers\u0026rsquo; Watch and the places adjoined.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/6550215721533187002gol1294.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/6550215721533187002gol1294.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not going to spoil any of the actual plot beyond that but the DLC follows a single main quest thread with two or three short side quests that can be taken in the new area. It took me around four or a bit more hours to see it all though, in typical Pillars and Obsidian fashion, how you approach the challenges is fairly open-ended. There are multiple ways to resolve things and there\u0026rsquo;s a fair effort made to accommodate most character types and dispositions. There\u0026rsquo;s a new companion that can be recruited, Vatnir the Godlike, but he seems more like an excuse for the plot than a memorable addition to the party. I haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered to replay the whole game with him but from what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen he\u0026rsquo;s simply a second-tier companion in that he has a few things to say here and there but you can\u0026rsquo;t really form a relationship beyond that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a lot to enjoy in this new part of the journey if you\u0026rsquo;re into the world building and lore of the Pillars universe. I know that that doesn\u0026rsquo;t appeal to every type of gamer but I found that the twists of the new quest line directly, and unexpectedly, fleshed out many of the things players hear about or had previously affected their life as the Watcher. Like with the rest of the game, there are references to the first title, but the new mysteries of the Deadfire Archipelago are also touched upon and I certainly appreciated how things seemed to tie in with the new environment visited and challenges presented. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t really affect the overall outcome of the game, and pretty much only adds a single new narration panel in the epilogue, but it certainly helped build up my interest in the game series and its world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI have to mention that I\u0026rsquo;m still in love with the general art style of the game. The new locations, and some of the puzzle mechanics that affect the environment, do look really great. There\u0026rsquo;s also a few new enemies and gear but these don\u0026rsquo;t stand out as much as the rest of the environs. Things aren\u0026rsquo;t just limited to the White that Wends, so don\u0026rsquo;t worry about getting too sick of seeing just snow and ice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-fancybox=\"images\" href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/2662225341533187002gol1294.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/2662225341533187002gol1294.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, is Beast of Winter worth getting? Despite its brief length and initially obvious premise, I enjoyed my time with it. It adds to the general experience of exploration and mystery the base game was already good at doing. In a few ways it\u0026rsquo;s a little too self-contained; at times it the new content feels like it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be out of place being just another one of the big islands you can chart and explore which often have their own distinct quests and sights to see. Although you do get a chance to interact with Rymrgand in the rest of the game, this DLC also affords you a better chance to appreciate just how fuzzy and warm this god really can be. There were one or two great dialog options that showed just how much I appreciated him and, in turn, saw me get a lovely and quite permanent reward. But that\u0026#39;s probably enough joking about the god of cold and entropy for the purpose of this review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI would have wished the adventure a bit longer, the new companion more interesting, and the quests little more non-linear or at least more in line with the free-flowing structure of the rest of the game. That said, those faults aren\u0026#39;t enough to seriously degrade the overall experience. Obsidian has played up its strengths well\u0026mdash;the world building is strong and the choices you can make continue to be interesting. The same care at making outcomes vary possibly as wildly or as subtly as you like, much as with the rest of the game, is very much present here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can grab Beast of Winter on \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/821940/Pillars_of_Eternity_II_Deadfire__Beast_of_Winter/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/pillars_of_eternity_ii_deadfire_the_beast_of_winter?pp=b2a10a6c3dcadb10c8ffd734c1bab896d55cf0ec\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGOG\u003c/a\u003e.

I currently use Ubuntu 18.04 with an Nvidia card, and its all going well. On Nvidia its simple, you install the Nvidia-driver-xxx package and reboot. But on AMD I have read about multiple drivers and that confuses me. First there is the built in (the kernel?) AMDVLK, which seems great but is not supported by DXVK. Bummer. Then there is the AMDGPU-PRO, that is the laughing stock of everyone apparently, and that you should not use but AMD still pushes it. Then the RADV, which is obtained with mesa\u0026#39;s package?... I don\u0026#39;t know, but it is supported by DXVK, so thats the one I want to use, but I see so many reports of hanging and issues, so I am unsure.

Will you fly as a pirate terrorizing shipping lanes, join the solar wars as a military captain, or track targets across the stars as a fearsome bounty hunter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s what the developers said about the release:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndrew Trese (Co-Founder, Trese Brothers Games):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026rsquo;re thrilled to deliver a fully-realized version of \u003cem\u003eStar Traders: Frontiers\u003c/em\u003e to our Steam players. The past few months have been crazy exciting and busy \u0026ndash; from daily bug fixing to adding heaps of new features and content. We wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here without the community, which has been absolutely amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eCory Trese (Co-Founder, Trese Brothers Games):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003cem\u003eStar Traders: Frontiers\u003c/em\u003e, we\u0026rsquo;ve returned to one of our favorite settings and put the player in command of a ship and crew. The story weaves together the relationships between captain and crew \u0026ndash; and the adventures they embark on together. Each choice the player makes within the story dramatically impacts the universe and the lives of those who populate it. We set out to demonstrate exactly how Early Access should be done. We did it the Trese Brothers way \u0026ndash; hammering out 87 updates, including huge new features and swathes of content, all without ever invalidating a saved game or pausing more than a few days between big updates. Throughout all this, we\u0026rsquo;ve also responded to every player thread on Steam. Yes, that might mean we\u0026rsquo;re crazy \u0026ndash; but interacting with our community is extremely important to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had some thoughts posted up from contributor BTRE \u003ca href=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/star-traders-frontiers-released-into-early-access-heres-a-few-thoughts.10714\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eback in November\u003c/a\u003e, obviously the game is quite different to then since it\u0026#39;s had around 80 patches to improve it.\u0026nbsp;There\u0026#39;s so much to talk about, I simply don\u0026#39;t know where to start and end with this one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirstly, it\u0026#39;s rubbish with two monitors. You either have to play it in windowed mode or disable a monitor for fullscreen before you load the game, otherwise it will spread itself across both monitors. Frustrating as hell, but it\u0026#39;s not the only game to have this problem. BTRE noted this back in November, so it\u0026#39;s a shame this hasn\u0026#39;t been solved many months later. They did at least solve the issue with tooltips not appearing in the Linux version, so that\u0026#39;s good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s quite an engrossing game, one with quite a lot of detail and a lot of different game mechanics. There\u0026#39;s a good amount of depth to it too, for example: Each crew member has their own statistics, they each level up with different abilities, they have different weapons and gear and so on. I spent a good half an hour just going over my crew list, it certainly sucks the time away from you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s interesting, is how they tied in their other games. You don\u0026#39;t need to have played them, I just found it interesting that the\u0026nbsp;Templar Knights from\u0026nbsp;Templar Battleforce came up during a conversation with a character.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s so much to talk about, even something as simple as flying from one location to another is full of surprises. You have an event log that fills up with details about what happens on board your ship\u0026nbsp;like fights breaking out, failed navigation through an asteroid field, officers preventing accidents and so on. By the time you reach your destination, you might find you\u0026#39;re in need of a few repairs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you like the idea of travelling the stars, upgrading your ship and making it your own, going on quests for various factions wrapped up in an ever-changing narrative then it might just be something for you. Honeslty, I\u0026#39;m a little overwhelmed by how big it is since there\u0026#39;s no tutorial but I quite like it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find it on \u003ca href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/335620/Star_Traders_Frontiers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSteam\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;with 20% off until August 7th.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/the-space-rpg-star-traders-frontiers-from-trese-brothers-games-is-now-out.12281","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-08-03T12:08:13.000Z"}}

If a truck is left sitting by the side of the road, they might attempt to hijack it and beat up the poor driver trying to earn a living. To help with this, there\u0026#39;s a new\u0026nbsp;Road Barrier object (basically a strong metal gate) which closes during a lockdown. Alternatively, you can place armed guards around to stop them getting into the truck in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, since Introversion added in rope escapes in update 14, you can now as of this update put barbed wire on top of walls. It might not actually stop them in their tracks though and it can injure them but it might be enough to slow them down to be captured. They also gained the ability to climb trees, so you might not want any trees near your walls, although they can be knocked off the tree by guards too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMight have to jump back in with the last few updates, since they\u0026#39;ve introduced some really interesting AI features like the above it certainly will make me re-think some designs I used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eReally fantastic to see\u0026nbsp;Prison Architect continue to be updated nearly three years after the official release.

Thankfully, you have quite a few tricks available. The mix of primary and secondary weapons, along with extra items like bombs, turrets and all sorts of special items really makes the combat interesting.

Players can also compete against one another in Internet and LAN matches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ships are highly detailed, teeming with sailors moving around at their individual tasks, like an ant farm or a cut-away drawing.

Whether it be a hot air balloon, a magical Wizard\u0026rsquo;s school or even another planet, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to be bready for anything. Work solo or with up to three friends to prep orders while overcoming obstacles such as fire, collapsing floors, overbearing waiters and of course, the classic kitchen problem of floating work surfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSeems like a rather nice game, especially with online multiplayer support opening it up to a much wider audience.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b6a2472835ac38de95ddfa1"},"name":"GamingOnLinux","title":"Exiled Kingdoms - a mobile RPG with decent depth, now on Linux","description":"\u003cp\u003eTags: RPG, Action, Adventure, Open World, Review, Steam\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cp\u003eHello and welcome to my first article on GOL. Today I will talk about a game I\u0026nbsp;played on Android and eventually on Linux called Exile Kingdoms. I first played this game on a tablet, under circumstances I have honestly forgotten, but it left an impression. I decided to pick it up on Steam to relive the experience on a more comfortable platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, I won\u0026#39;t lie, the game is primitive by modern standards. The graphics are somewhere between Dink Smallwood and Diablo 1, and the combat is retro with lots of stutter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet despite all this, I like it. I like it a lot. So why is that? Well for one it has a big world. And due to the lack of fast travel, excluding mage towers that can teleport you, it just \u003cem\u003efeels\u003c/em\u003e big. In this respect it reminds me of Morrowind, where you had to use Silt Striders and Mage Guilds to move long distances. Oblivion, by comparison, seemed to lose a lot by allowing the player to teleport everywhere like Captain Picard.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile\u0026nbsp;combat looks primitive, it has depth. You have four classes and multiple damage types such as lightning and\u0026nbsp;death magic. You can plan tactics versus certain monsters, learn about their weaknesses from talking to NPCs and use various items and potions to your benefit. This actually reminded me of the preparations you undertook in the Witcher games, brewing potions and oils and using various spells to outwit monsters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe classes are pretty standard, almost taken straight from the MMO template of\u0026nbsp;Warrior, Rogue, Mage and Cleric. There is a variety of skills to learn and picking one and then focusing on it can make a \u003cstrong\u003ebig\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003edifference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a warrior I chose two-handed weapons. When I got to the last level\u0026nbsp;I had a good chance to stun enemies in combat which saved my butt many times when my health was running low!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/4123422301533679421gol573.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGameplay is fairly standard. You go from town to town completing quests and progressing towards your main goal. Most towns have standard merchants to help you out such as the inn, blacksmith or priest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou get two uses per day of an ability that fully restores you, then you must rest at an inn. The cost to rest increases per level. You \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e get healing potions but early on they\u0026#39;re expensive and money is best spent on equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.gamingonlinux.com/uploads/articles/article_media/13178558111533679422gol573.jpg\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother good thing is that the game rewards quest completion far more than level grinding. The quests are fairly basic as usually you\u0026nbsp;must kill enemies to get to the objective, but the context is often interesting in each case. For example, \u0026quot;Recover a mace from the tortured soul of a monk\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;Obtain war plans from orcs\u0026quot;. And nobody suggests that you \u003cem\u003emust \u003c/em\u003ekill everything on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is also a\u0026nbsp;faction system that adds even more depth. The factions are non compatible so you may need several playthroughs depending who you support. Again I have to draw a parallel to the Elder Scrolls games, namely Skyrim. But in Skyrim, you could join the assassins, culminating in you killing the Emperor, then as if nothing happened, you could join the imperial army to fight rebels. Here your choices seems to matter. For example I decided to be kind to an imprisoned savage and give him a wolf skin that reminded him of his North homeland. This pleased \u0026quot;Savages\u0026quot; and increased my reputation with them but decreased my reputation with \u0026quot;Desert Kingdoms\u0026quot; who kept slaves and another faction (which I sadly do not recall).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother example is the religion in the land. Nobles worship at grand temples while the common folk worship the Three (sort of a play on the Holy Trinity). The priests of the noble caste scoff at you for helping the priests of the Three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYet another example is in the third town. A lady who is a spice merchant has lost an amulet certifying her bloodline as a merchant and so cannot sell to the upper class. She offers\u0026nbsp;a quest to recover her amulet but as I leave town, the merchant guild ask me to return her amulet to them so they will have a monopoly on the market. This does add an element of depth that keeps the story interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also random encounters which\u0026nbsp;will spawn in your travels. It could be a thief desperate to sell some \u0026quot;hot\u0026quot; property, an alchemist or armourer selling their wares or some savage hunters willing to buy wolf skins from you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell, while I admit that the presentation is flawed, the game does compensate\u0026nbsp;well with its depth and the interesting world. If you are unsure that you would like this, I\u0026#39;d suggest perhaps get it on sale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s the\u0026nbsp;trailer:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"youtube-embed-wrapper\" data-video-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGlfQMY1Y3w?rel=0\" style=\"position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;padding-top:30px;height:0;overflow:hidden\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGlfQMY1Y3w?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMinor note : I gifted a copy to Samsai,\u0026nbsp;who played it on stream.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5b6b8407835ac38de963878a"},"name":"linux_gaming","title":"Mark my words: steam will come out with a major linux-exclusive (or at least a game that comes to linux first), while microsoft studios will force a g","description":"\u003c!-- SC_OFF --\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"md\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAllow me to explain. First of all, consider microsoft\u0026#39;s position. They don\u0026#39;t much care about games -- don\u0026#39;t get me wrong, they quite like being the dominant pc gaming platform, but they feel comfortable in that position and not like they\u0026#39;re going to go anywhere. However, they\u0026#39;re uncomfortable with the state of (non-game) software discovery. If ever anyone wants to get a piece of software, they search on the internet, maybe get a good download, maybe get an adware-riddled one from sourceforge or cnet, maybe get straight malware. This reflects poorly on microsoft when it\u0026#39;s very easy to download malicious software and get a virus (I know you personally don\u0026#39;t think less of microsoft because it\u0026#39;s so easy to get infected, but less technically-inclined people definitely will). As such, they want a curated platform that\u0026#39;s the go-to place to get software, \u003cem\u003esuch as\u003c/em\u003e the windows store. This is why they don\u0026#39;t \u003cem\u003enecessarily\u003c/em\u003e see valve as a threat, since valve also offers curation and auditing and isn\u0026#39;t known to have malware. Nevertheless, they want to bring people to the microsoft store, which currently has precious few offerings that are actually worth taking, and as such no one is using it, so no one thinks to bring new software there. It\u0026#39;s a classic bootstrap problem. Now, if there\u0026#39;s a new AAA highly-anticipated game but it\u0026#39;s only on the microsoft store, then maybe there will be a huge rush of people who \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e technically-inclined, generally use steam/gog, reluctantly going to the windows store to buy this one title. This means a lot more eyeballs on the windows store, even if it\u0026#39;s just briefly, but it also means that these people will become comfortable with the process of using the windows store. This could incentivize software developers who \u003cem\u003ehaven\u0026#39;t\u003c/em\u003e achieved success to release something high quality on the windows store, because there will be a lot of eyeballs on it and it\u0026#39;ll stand out from the rest of the chaff. Then the gamers will see this piece of software and think \u0026#39;huh, maybe the windows store isn\u0026#39;t \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e bad. After all, there is this game, and I found a new piece of neat software!\u0026#39; And that\u0026#39;s just the push that the windows store would need to get going.\u003c/p\u003e \u003chr/\u003e \u003cp\u003eNow, on the other hand, consider valve. \u003cem\u003eValve is scared shitless of microsoft\u003c/em\u003e! This is because even though they\u0026#39;re The Place To Go to get games, microsoft has something even more powerful. Microsoft has the microsoft store preinstalled, which means that people who don\u0026#39;t know what they\u0026#39;re doing could stumble around, find games on the microsoft store, and conclude that\u0026#39;s the place to go, and that represents a much large demographic. That\u0026#39;s why they\u0026#39;re betting so heavily on linux because, even though there are \u0026#39;software stores\u0026#39; on linux (really just graphical frontends for dnf/apt/whatever, but they serve the purpose), there is no mechanism to pay for software, so steam is really the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e place to go. If they release a game on linux only, or linux first, or with a cheaper linux version, many windows-only users will say \u0026#39;oh, I want to play that game! I don\u0026#39;t want to wait!\u0026#39; and learn to install linux even if only for that one game. This has the same effects of familiarizing people with the platform as the microsoft store and again helps bootstrap it because game developers will see that more people are on linux.\u003c/p\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003c!-- SC_ON --\u003e \u0026#32; submitted by \u0026#32; \u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Elronnd\"\u003e /u/Elronnd \u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/95r7n6/mark_my_words_steam_will_come_out_with_a_major/\"\u003e[link]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u0026#32; \u003cspan\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/95r7n6/mark_my_words_steam_will_come_out_with_a_major/\"\u003e[comments]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/95r7n6/mark_my_words_steam_will_come_out_with_a_major/","type":"article","date":{"$date":"2018-08-08T23:26:32.000Z"}}
